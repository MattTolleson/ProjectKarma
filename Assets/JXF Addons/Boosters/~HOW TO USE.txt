HOW TO USE "JXF Boosters"

step 1:  Drag the booster prefab to your game scene

step 2: Re-arrange the placement to fit your scene

step 3: play the scene... simple!

step 4: Add/Adjust the script behaviour as necessary.

----------------

P.S.> Booster.cs script is the master script that decides how the items are used.
      All other scripts inherits from this main script. The other scripts simply specifies what powers they have only.




Further Customisation
==========================

1) You can change the GUIs of the booster prefab to suit your liking. Simply swap out the sprites provided :)

2) You can change the booster's script simply by re-assigning another booster script OR
   deleting the old script and adding a new booster script to the GameObject.

3) You can change some simple default properties via the individual booster's inspector in Unity.

----------------

4) Feel free to add / modify the available script to meet your custom needs.
However, please keep track of the changes made to make it easier for your to merge with future updates. TQ
